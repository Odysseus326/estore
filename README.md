<h2>HOW IT WAS MADE</h2>
<p>This website was built using the React library for the front-end, and Spring Boot w/ MySQL for the back-end. </p>

<p> Evan build the backend entirely utilizing Spring Boot's Web, JPA (MySQL), Security, and Lombok Dependencies, all built with Maven.</p>

<p>The websites security utilized a basic authentication process (username/password) and a bearer token (JWT) process</p>

<p>The front-end was not built by Evan, however portions of it were changed by him. The front-end uses React (JS) and Bootstrap.

<p>This completed project mostly serves as a portfolio piece, although Evan and his partner may one day make this project into something they can use.</p>
